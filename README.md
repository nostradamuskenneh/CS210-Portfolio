# CS210 Portfolio: Investment Calculator

## Project Summary
This project implements an Investment Calculator in C++. The program allows users to calculate the growth of their investments over time, with options to include or exclude monthly deposits. It solves the problem of manually calculating compound interest and helps users visualize the long-term effects of their investment strategies.

## Reflections

### What I Did Well
- Implemented a clear and modular structure using object-oriented programming principles.
- Created a user-friendly interface with clear input prompts and formatted output.
- Utilized vector data structures to store and manage calculation results efficiently.
- Implemented error handling for user inputs (though this could be expanded further).

### Areas for Enhancement
- Input validation could be improved to handle non-numeric inputs and negative values.
- The program could benefit from additional features like different compounding periods or variable interest rates.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) could make the program more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Adding an option to save results to a file would enhance the program's utility.

### Challenging Aspects
The most challenging part was ensuring accurate calculations, especially when dealing with compound interest and monthly deposits. I overcame this by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and using a nested loop structure to calculate monthly and yearly totals. I relied on C++ documentation and financial calculation resources to verify my approach.

### Transferable Skills
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Financial calculations and algorithms
- User input handling and data validation
- Formatting and displaying data in a clear, tabular format

### Maintaining Code Quality
To ensure the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable:
- I used clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- I separated the implementation into header and source files for better organization.
- I used comments to explain complex calculations and program flow.
- I structured the code to allow easy addition of new features or modifications to existing ones.

This project has strengthened my C++ skills and given me practical experience in creating a useful financial tool. It has also improved my ability to translate real-world problems into programming solutions.
